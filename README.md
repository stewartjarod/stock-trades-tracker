# stock-trades-tracker
Stock Trades Tracker plugin for BitBar

## Future goals for plugin
- Track exits
- Save full trade in separate file (buy price, sell price, numbers of shares, total gain/loss)
- Track portfolio value over time, am I on track for my goals?
- Try to hook into Robinhood's API? Other brokerage API's to get trades automagically

## Inspirations from the following plugins:
- https://github.com/lukstei/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Finance/stock-portfolio-pl.5m.py
- https://github.com/carlsonorozco/coin-alert
